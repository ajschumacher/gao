# GAO docket

A client/scraper for GAO bid protests.

## What's the point?

[GAO](http://gao.gov)'s [bid protest decisions](http://gao.gov/legal/bid-protests/search) are awesome. I want to *know* them through data science. But first, I must access all of them and I must build a wrapper/scraper to get them all.
